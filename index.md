## Introduction

Hello, my name is Rakib.

## Project Overview

This project showcases a console-based animation inspired by the iconic digital rain effect from *The Matrix*. It demonstrates the use of modern C++ features to create a visually engaging experience in the terminal.

**Features:**

- **Smooth Animated Console Rain:**  
  Simulates falling characters using random positioning, character selection, and frame timing.

- **Custom Console Cursor Control:**  
  Utilizes `GotoXY()` with Windows `COORD` to move the cursor with precision.

- **Randomized Color Effects:**  
  Adds vibrant, changing colors for a dynamic visual experience.

- **Efficient Console Manipulation:**  
  Leveraging low-level Windows API functions like `SetConsoleCursorPosition` and `SetConsoleTextAttribute`.

- **Expandable Architecture:**  
  Modular class-based structure using C++ headers and source files â€“ great for learning and future expansion.

**Code Highlights:**

- *Italic* and **Bold** text formatting.
- Inline code can be highlighted using backticks, e.g., `std::cout << "Hello, World!";`.
- Hyperlinks can be included like this: [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/).

**Key Components:**

- **Vectors:**  
  Used for managing collections of data efficiently.

- **Algorithms:**  
  Implemented to handle character generation and animation timing.

- **Iterators:**  
  Employed to traverse and manipulate data structures seamlessly.
